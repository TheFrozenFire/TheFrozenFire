## Currently

Doing applied zero knowledge application development, currently focused on client-side-friendly ZK proofs for on-chain KYC/AML. My research focus is in how one builds user-facing zero knowledge protocols which use simple cryptographic primitives, have minimal verification costs, clear trust assumptions, and which are relatively simple to audit. I am particularly focused on creating ZK protocols which interoperate with real world concerns such as legal reputation, regulatory compliance, and real world identity.
